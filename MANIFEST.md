# Manifest for l3build

This file is a listing of all files considered to be part of this package.
It is automatically generated with `texlua build.lua manifest`.


## Repository manifest

The following groups list the files included in the development repository of the package.
Files listed with a ‘†’ marker are included in the TDS but not CTAN files, and files listed
with ‘‡’ are included in both.


## Source files

These are source files for a number of purposes, including the `unpack` process which
generates the installation files of the package. Additional files included here will also
be installed for processing such as testing.
* l3build.dtx 
* l3build-aux.lua 
* l3build-check.lua 
* l3build-clean.lua

## Test files

These files form the test suite for the package. `.lvt` or `.lte` files are the individual

the same output. These output files are sometimes shared and sometime specific for
different engines (pdfTeX, XeTeX, LuaTeX, etc.).
